We will inform you regarding such modifications by either notifying you via email or by posting such latest changes on the Site. You should continue checking the Site for changes. Your continued use of this Site or of the Project Management Service, as applicable, ten (10) days following the posting of changes to these Terms or providing notice to you, whichever occurs first, will mean you accept those changes.

The Project Management Service.
					</div>
					<div>
The terms of this Section 5 apply only to subscribers to the Project Management Service.
						<ol>
							<li>
<strong>Account Registration.</strong> In order to access and use the Project Management Service, you will be required to create an account ("Account") and otherwise comply with these Terms. The Site offers you the option of creating an Account by completing an online registration form or by linking to an account that you may have with Facebook, Yahoo!, LinkedIn or other third party websites designated on the Site. You agree not to create an Account for anyone else or use the account of another without their permission. When creating your Account, you must provide accurate, current and complete information.  If your information changes, you agree to promptly make the related changes in your Account so that your information remains accurate, current, and complete at all times. You are solely responsible and liable for the activity that occurs in connection with and in your Account or password, and you agree to keep your Account password confidential and secure at all times.  You must notify Gigantt immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your Account.  
							</li>
							<li>
<strong>How We Secure your Data.</strong> We recognize that when you subscribe to the Project Management Service, you entrust us with your sensitive work plans and proprietary information, and it is important to us to secure any data that you submit or upload using the Project Management Service ("Project Data"). Our systems are designed to be resistant to hardware failure and data loss by being fully redundant. This means we have spare machines to handle unexpected failures, and we store multiple copies of your data in separate places. In addition, since it is possible for entire data centers to become unavailable, we securely backup Project Data through multiple third-party hosting providers. We take measures to protect Project Data even against accidental deletion. This means that even if you perform a delete operation on any part of your Project Data, we still retain a copy of that Project Data in our backups and history for a period of up to 24 months after termination of your subscription to the Project Management Service, subject to applicable law. However, please note that despite our best efforts, there is always a risk of data loss due to accident, bugs or hacking, and as further detailed below, Gigantt is not liable for loss of Project Data or other Data.
							</li>
							<li>
<strong>Rights in Project Data.</strong> You represent that you are the sole owner of any Project Data and that you have good title and all ownership rights and intellectual property rights (including all copyrights, patents, trade secret rights and trademarks) in and to the Project Data. 
Gigantt believes that you should always be able to use data that belong to you. As such, you will have the ability to access and retrieve your Project Data at any given time, whether or not you are subscribed to the Project Management Service at such time, for a period of up to 24 months after termination of your subscription to the Project Management Service.
							</li>
							<li>
<strong>Rights in the Project Management Service.</strong> Gigantt retains all title, ownership rights and intellectual property rights (including all copyrights, patents, trade secret rights and trademarks) in and to the Project Management Service.
							</li>
							<li>
<strong>Termination of the Project Management Service.</strong> If at any time you wish to discontinue using the Project Management Service, You may cancel your Account by using the tools provided on the Site. Gigantt reserves the right to terminate your access to the Project Management Service immediately and without notice if you fail to comply with these Terms. Upon termination of the Project Management Service, your access to the Project Management Service will be discontinued, but you will be able to access and retrieve your project data for a period of up to 24 months. During this period you will have only read-access to your information and will not be able to edit it. Termination for any reason will not entitle you to a refund of any fees paid by you to Gigantt.

Privacy Policy.
					</div>
					<div>
Your privacy and the privacy of other users of the Site and Project Management Service are important to us. The terms of this Section 6 set forth our privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your Personal Information is collected and used in connection with the Site and the Project Management Service.  “Personal Information” means any information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a personal profile, an email address, telephone number, a home or other physical address, or other contact information.
						<ol>
							<li>
								<div class="tos_section">
	Information We Collect and How We Collect It.
								</div>
								<div>
	We do not currently require you to provide Personal Information in order to have access to general information available on the Site. We do, however, receive and/or collect information from you in the following ways:
								</div>
								<ol>
									<li>
	<strong>Account Registration.</strong> In order to provide you with the Project Management Service, you are required to first create an Account.  We offer two ways to create an Account:
										<ol>
											<li>
	Online Registration Form:  You can complete and submit an online registration form which we make available on the Site.  You will be asked to provide us with information such as your name, an email address, and a password that you will use for your Account. We will use this information to distinguish you from other users and to provide you with the Project Management Service.
											</li>
											<li>
	Third Party Account:  You can click on a sign-in box that we may display on the Site for Facebook, Yahoo!, LinkedIn or other third party websites designated on the Site (each a "Third Party Account").  Doing so will enable you to link your Site account and your Third Party Account.  If you choose this option, then a Third Party Account authentication process will take place which will describe the types of information that we will obtain from, and the types of activities that we may perform in connection with, your Third Party Account. By linking your Account and your Third Party Account, you grant us authorization to collect the information that you make available to us from your Third Party Account. 
											</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
									<li>
	<strong>Project Data.</strong> If you submit Project Data, then we will receive and store such Project Data, whether or not it includes Personal Information. We collect this information solely for the purpose of providing you with the Project Management Service. Only select employees in Gigantt have access to your Project Data, and it is our policy not to read it unless you ask us to do so (e.g. for technical support purposes). 
									</li>
									<li>
	<strong>Log Files.</strong> The Site may make use of log files. The information inside the log files includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, type of browser, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, clicked pages and any other information your browser may send to us or that our client application may send to our servers during the normal functioning of the system.  We may use such information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user's movement around the Site, learn how our users utilize the system and which features are used more often than others, gather demographic information, and improve our service by letting us know how well our Site and our Project Management Service performs for you.
									</li>
									<li>
	<strong>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.</strong> Some of our Site pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies.  A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about Site activity.  Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information previously indicated by a Site user.  Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.  You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser.

IF YOU SUBSCRIBE TO THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT SERVICE, YOU AGREE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ALTHOUGH GIGANTT USES ITS REASONABLE COMMERCIAL EFFORTS TO MAKE THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT SERVICE ACCURATE, SECURE AND RELIABLE, IT CANNOT AND DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT SERVICE SHALL AT ALL TIMES BE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, SECURE, RELIABLE, CURRENT, OR ERROR-FREE.

11.	Limitation of Liability.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL GIGANTT, ITS AFFILIATES OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, LICENSORS, ASSIGNS AND AGENTS BE LIABLE FOR ANY ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL DAMAGE THAT MAY BE CAUSED TO YOU AND/OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOSS OF MONEY, GOODWILL, REPUTATION, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, DIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY LOSS OF DATA OR BREACH OF DATA SECURITY) THAT RESULT FROM THE USE OF, OR THE INABILITY TO USE, THE SITE OR THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT SERVICE AND ANY OTHER SERVICE AVAILABLE ON THE SITE, EVEN IF GIGANTT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN ANY EVENT AND WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THIS SECTION, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT GIGANTT’S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES AND LOSSES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SITE SHALL NOT IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCES EXCEED $100.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

GIGANTT THEREFORE CANNOT WARRANT AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY WITH RESPECT TO THE INTEGRITY, RELIABILITY, SECURITY, QUALITY AND AVAILABILITY OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE CLOUD STORAGE PROVIDERS AND THEIR EFFECT ON THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT SERVICE AND/OR PROJECT DATA.

Gigantt reserves the right to discontinue or modify any aspect of the Site and the Project Management Service at any time.

You and Gigantt agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Tel Aviv and waive any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to such courts. These Terms, together with any other legal notices published by Gigantt on the Site, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Gigantt concerning the Site and your subscription to and use of the Project Management Service. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect.
